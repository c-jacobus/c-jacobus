Hello!
I am an undergraduate researcher at UC Berkeley's [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu/) and Lawrence Berkeley Lab's [Center for Computational Cosmology]([https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/c3/](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/c3/c3-people/cooper-jacobus/)). I am interested in Computational Physics, the Large Scale Structure of the Cosmos, and the Philosophy of Physics. I am excited about the prospect of understanding the nature of Intelligence and the origin of the Cosmos. As an undergrad at Berkeley I persue these interests through the [Major in Astrophysics](http://kartp.astro.berkeley.edu/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=curriculum:undergrad_info_for_web.pdf) studying Cosmology, Bayesian Analysis, and Fluid Mechanics and through the [Minor in Mathematical Logic](https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/logic/logic.pdf) studying probability, graph theory, and quantum computing.

Basically, I am excited about problems having to do with these two (related!) questions: 'In what ways is the Universe like a Computer?' and 'In what ways is a Computer like a Brain?' For instance, a question I've been pursuing for the past few years is 'Can we construct a *Neural Algorithm* that accurately captures and reconstructs the physics which sculps the Cosmos?'

I am honored to be financially supported by the Goldwater and NASA Astronaut Scholarships as well as the UC Berkeley Leadership Award. 

In my (limited) free time I enjoy hiking, traveling, and volunteering as a teacher.
