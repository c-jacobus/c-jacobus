Hello!
I am an undergraduate student-researcher at UC Berkeley's [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu/) and Lawrence Berkeley Lab's [Center for Computational Cosmology](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/c3/). I am interested in Physical Cosmology, Computational Physics, Intelligence, Inflation, Large Scale Structure, and the Philosophy of Physics. I believe that we ought to understand the nature of Intelligence and the origin of the Cosmos in order to grasp our place in the multiverse and chart the future path of human kind. As an undergrad at Berkeley I study these interests through the [Astrophysics Major](http://kartp.astro.berkeley.edu/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=curriculum:undergrad_info_for_web.pdf) and the [Minor in Mathematical Logic](https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/logic/logic.pdf).
