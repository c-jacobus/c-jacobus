Hello!
I am an undergraduate student-researcher at UC Berkeley's [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu/) and Lawrence Berkeley Lab's [Center for Computational Cosmology](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/c3/). I am interested in Physical Cosmology, Computational Physics, Intelligence, Inflation, the Large Scale Structure of the Cosmos, and the Philosophy and Metamathematics of Physics. I believe that we ought to understand the nature of Intelligence, Axiomatic Knowledge, and the origin of the Cosmos in order to grasp our place in the multiverse and chart the future path of humankind. As an undergrad at Berkeley I study these interests through the [Major in Astrophysics](http://kartp.astro.berkeley.edu/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=curriculum:undergrad_info_for_web.pdf) and the [Minor in Mathematical Logic](https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/logic/logic.pdf).

Basically, I am excited about problems having to do with these two (related!) questions: 'In what ways is a Universe like a Computer?' and 'In what ways is a Computer like a Brain?' For instance, a question I've been pursuing for the past few years is 'Can we construct a *Neural Algorithm* that accurately captures the physics which sculps the Cosmos?'

I am honored to be financially supported by the Goldwater and NASA Astronaut Scholarships and the UC Berkeley Leadership Award.
