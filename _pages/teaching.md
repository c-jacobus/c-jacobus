By far the most enjoyable aspect of my physics career so far has been teaching. I used to volunteer at my local science center and I have served for three years as a TA for our Introductory Astronomy class at Berkeley. I have come to discover a deep fulfillment in teaching Astronomy and Physics, particularly in teaching students who are just now being exposed to the poetic and fundamentally exciting aspects of this field which I so love.
